# ivan-ilyin.github.io

Simple project to refresh github skills and set up a github pages site as a personal website for resume purposes.
Nothing fancy just yet, simply an html page and some assets.
Experimenting with latest meta tags, html5 changes, local fonts, w3c stylesheet, some minor embedded JS to obfuscate my email address, and a minimal design.

Plans: Expand site to include more information and resources about me, consider adding projects or portfolio items, and experiment with Jekyll themes and try some js frameworks for fancy functionality and design.
