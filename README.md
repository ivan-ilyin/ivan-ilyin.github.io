Simple project to refresh github skills and set up a github pages site as a personal website for resume purposes.

Slight change of plans - going to attempt to rebuild this in React as practice and expand some of the info and hopefully capabilities of the site. Hopefully this is possible on a branch rather than a whole new repo...
